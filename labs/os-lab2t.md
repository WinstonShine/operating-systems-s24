Lab 2t

For this lab I worked with Duck. We tried running schedule.py and tried to figure out how these
different scheduling schemes are different. We also discussed how to compute the response times.
I believe the problems we left off on were problems 3 & 4. We struggled to figure out a way
calculate the response time with a RR scheduler.
